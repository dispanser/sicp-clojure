* SICP Examples and Exercises in Clojure

This tracks my personal adventure working my way through [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/][SICP]], and is
based on the [[https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf][sicp-pdf]] project on github.

The repository will contain most of the example source code and exercise
solutions, currently organized in one big file per chapter. There are a few
omissions, usually indicating that I'm too dumb, tired or lazy.
The source code sometimes deviates from the code samples in that it uses some
features that are introduced later in the text, i.e. let expressions are used
from the beginning, later I realized that I'm not supposed to know them yet.
